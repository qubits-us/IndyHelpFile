# IndyHelpFile
Help file for Indy

Had to install the Indy help file by hand on my Delphi install..
No, I don't know, why..
I put these files into "C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\22.0\Help\Doc"
And then I have a selection under the Third-Party Help for Indy.

Maybe this helps someone else.
